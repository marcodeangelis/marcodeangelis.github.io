 abstract = {In this dissertation, Random Sets and advanced sampling techniques are combined for general and efficient uncertainty quantification. Random Sets extend the traditional probabilistic framework, as they also comprise imprecision to account for scarce data, lack of knowledge, vagueness, subjectivity, etc. The general attitude of Random Sets to include different kinds of uncertainty is paid to a very high computational price. In fact, Random Sets requires a min-max convolution for each sample picked by the Monte Carlo method. The speed of the min-max convolution can be sensibly increased when the system response relationship is known in analytical form. However, in a general multidisciplinary design context, the system response is very often treated as a "black box"},
