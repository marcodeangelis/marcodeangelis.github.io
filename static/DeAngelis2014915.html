 abstract = {In this paper, a novel implementation of the Line Sampling method for computing imprecise probabilities is presented. The model of uncertainty is generalised to include both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties which comprise gaps of knowledge and scarcity of data. The proposed generalised uncertainty model allows for sets of probability distribution functions - also known as credal sets - and sets of bounded variables. The proposed implementation, based on the Adaptive Line Sampling algorithm, not only makes the computation of single probabilities a lot faster but, most importantly, eases the search for lower and upper bounds of the failure probability. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},
