 abstract = {This paper presents an open computational framework for reliability based. The framework has been designed to provide the maximum flexibility allowing the state of the art in reliability analysis (e.g. adopting advanced Monte Carlo methods) to be combined in the direct approach as well as in the construction of the different type of meta-models (e.g. response surface, artificial neural networks, kriging model and polynomial chaos, etc.). A set of widely used gradient-based and gradient-free optimization algorithms are also available for performing the optimization step as well as high performance computing capability. Numerical applications show the applicability and flexibility of the proposed framework for solving real-life problems. © Civil-Comp Press, 2012.},
