 abstract = {The concept of formative assessment is considered by many to play an important role in enhancing teaching in higher engineering education. In this paper, the concept of the flipped classroom as part of a blended learning curriculum is highlighted as an ideal medium through which formative assessment practices arise. Whilst the advantages of greater interaction between students and lecturers in classes are numerous, there are often clear disadvantages associated with the independent home-study component that complements timetabled sessions in a flipped classroom setting, specifically, the popular method of replacing traditional classroom teaching with video lectures. This leads to a clear lack of assurances that the cited benefits of a flipped classroom approach are echoed in the home-study arena. Over the past three years, the authors have sought to address identified deficiencies in this area of blended learning through the development of database-driven e-learning software with the capability of introducing formative assessment practices to independent home-study. This paper maps out aspects of two specific evolving practices at separate institutions, from which guiding principles of incorporating formative assessment aspects into e-learning software are identified and highlighted in the context of independent home-study as part of a flipped classroom approach. © 2017 SEFI.},
