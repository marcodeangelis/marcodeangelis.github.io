 abstract = {Structural reliability methods are nowadays a cornerstone for the design ofrobustly performing structures, thanks to advancements in modeling andsimulation tools. Monte-Carlo based simulation tools have been shown toprovide the necessary accuracy and flexibility. While standard Monte-Carloestimation of the probability of failure is not hindered in its applicability byapproximations or limiting assumptions, it becomes computationally unfea-sible when small failure probability needs to be estimated, especially whenthe underlying numerical model evaluation is time consuming. In this case, variance reduction techniques are commonly employed, al-lowing for the estimation of small failure probabilities with a reduced numberof samples and model calls. As a competing approach to variance reductiontechniques, surrogate models can be used to substitute the computationally expensive model and performance function with an easy to evaluate numeri-cal function calibrated through a supervised learning procedure. Both thesetools provide accurate results for structural application. However, partic-ular care should be taken into account when the reliability problems deal with high dimensional or strongly non-linear structural performances since the accuracy of the estimate is largely dependent on choices made during thesurrogate modeling process. In this work, we compare the performance of themost recent state-of-the-art advance Monte-Carlo techniques and surrogate models when applied to strongly non-linear performance functions. This willprovide the analysts with an insight to the issues that could arise in thesechallenging problems and help to decide with confidence on which tool to select in order to achieve accurate estimation of the failure probabilities withinfeasible times with their available computational capabilities.
